	<tr><td>The <span class=product>rwt-lineup</span> web component is a flexible menu using round images as hyperlinks, with a pullbar to expand items that have overflowed its single-line container.</td></tr>
</table>

### Motivation

Sometimes a visual menu is better than a textual menu.

The <span>rwt-lineup</span> web component applies circular styling to
square images, providing a fully iconic interface. For situations where there
are too many hyperlinks to fit in a single line, the extras are kept hidden
until activated by the user, using either the visual pullbar or the component's `toggleMenu`
method or through its event interface.

This component is a light-hearted take on "The Line Up" of "all the usual
suspects". It's designed for use in a website's top banner area.

The component has these features:

   * A single line of icons is displayed in the container's collapsed state. The full
      set of icons is display in the expanded state, accommodating any number of menu
      items.
   * The menu item corresponding to the current page is highlighted and scrolled into
      view when the page is loaded.
   * The menu has an event interface for expanding and collapsing itself.
   * The menu emits a custom event to close sibling menus and dialog boxes.
   * Menu items may be kept separate from the web component, allowing the webmaster
      to change its contents in a single centralized place. Alternatively, menu items
      may be slotted directly between the component's opening and closing tags.
   * A keyboard listener is provided to allow a shortcut key to expand/collapse the
      menu.
   * A half-height pullbar for expanding the container is displayed along the bottom
      margin, appearing larger on hover.
   * The first few times that a visitor interacts with your website, the pullbar
      pulses to draw attention to itself.

#### Prerequisites

The <span>rwt-lineup</span> web component works in any browser that
supports modern W3C standards. It has no other prerequisites. Distribution and
installation are done with either NPM or via Github.

#### Installation using NPM

If you are familiar with Node.js and the `package.json` file, you'll be
comfortable installing the component just using this command:

```bash
npm install rwt-lineup
```

If you are a front-end Web developer with no prior experience with NPM, follow
these general steps:

   * Install <a href='https://nodejs.org'>Node.js/NPM</a>
on your development computer.
   * Create a `package.json` file in the root of your web project using the command:
```bash
npm init
```

   * Download and install the web component using the command:
```bash
npm install rwt-lineup
```


Important note: This web component uses Node.js and NPM and `package.json` as a
convenient *distribution and installation* mechanism. The web component itself
does not need them.

#### Installation using Github

If you are more comfortable using Github for installation, follow these steps:

   * Create a directory `node_modules` in the root of your web project.
   * Clone the <span>rwt-lineup</span> web component into it using the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/readwritetools/rwt-lineup.git
```


### Using the web component

After installation, you need to add two things to your HTML page to make use of
it.

   * Add a `script` tag to load the component's `rwt-lineup.js` file:
```html
<script src='/node_modules/rwt-lineup/rwt-lineup.js' type=module></script>             
```

   * Add the component tag somewhere on the page.

      * For scripting purposes, apply an `id` attribute.
      * Apply a `sourceref` attribute with a reference to an HTML file containing the
         menu's hyperlinks.
      * Optionally, apply a `shortcut` attribute with something like `F9`, `F10`, etc. for
         hotkey access.
      * For WAI-ARIA accessibility apply a `role=navigation` attribute.
      * For simple menus, the `sourceref` may be omitted and the menu hyperlinks may be
         slotted into the web component. Simply place the hyperlinks directly between the
`<rwt-lineup>` and `</rwt-lineup>` tags.
      * Here's an example HTML tag where the menu items are in a separate file:
```html
<rwt-lineup id=lineup sourceref='/menu.html' shortcut=F10 role=navigation></rwt-lineup>
```


#### Menu template

The content and format of the menu items should follow this pattern, which uses
anchors `<a>` that enclose images `<img>`.

```html
<a href='/path/to/page1.html' tabindex=301 <img src='/img/page1.jpg' title='Page 1' ></a>
<a href='/path/to/page2.html' tabindex=301 <img src='/img/page2.jpg' title='Page 2' ></a>
<a href='/path/to/page3.html' tabindex=301 <img src='/img/page3.jpg' title='Page 3' ></a>
```

#### Self identification

The menu item corresponding to the current page can be highlighted when it
identifies itself to the menu. This is accomplished by adding a `meta` tag to the
page that contains the short-form URL of the page itself. For example, if the
page's full URL is `https://example.com:443/services.html` the shortform URL would
be `/services.html`.

The short-form URL should be added to a special-purpose `meta` tag, like this:

```html
<meta name='lineup:this-url' content='/services.html' />
```

### Customization

#### Menu item size and spacing

The images that you provide should be square. They will be resized using the
value you specify with the CSS `--img-size` variable. Spacing between the icons
can be adjusted with the `--img-margin` variable.

The height of the pullbar can be made more or less prominent by setting the `--pullbar-height`
variable.

The `--width` variable can be used to shorten the width of the component's inner
container.

```css
rwt-lineup {
    --img-size: 64px;
    --img-margin: 16px;
    --width: 100%;
    --pullbar-height: 1rem;
}
```

#### Menu color scheme

The default color palette for the menu uses a dark mode theme. You can use CSS
to override the variables' defaults:

```css
rwt-lineup {
    --color: var(--pure-white);
    --accent-color1: var(--title-blue);
    --accent-color2: var(--yellow);
    --accent-color3: var(--dark-gray);
    --background: var(--transparent-black);
    --accent-background1: var(--light-black);
    --accent-background2: var(--pure-black);
}
```

### Event interface

The menu can be controlled with its event interface.

The component listens on DOM `document` for `toggle-lineup` messages. Upon receipt
it will expand or collapse the menu.

The component listens on DOM `document` for `keydown` messages. If the user presses
the configured shortcut key (<kbd>F9</kbd>, <kbd>F10</kbd>, etc) it will
collapse/expand the menu. The <kbd>Esc</kbd> key collapses the menu.

The component listens on DOM `document` for `collapse-popup` messages, which are
sent by sibling menus or dialog boxes. Upon receipt it will collapse itself.

The component listens on DOM `document` for `click` messages. When the user clicks
anywhere outside the menu, it collapses itself.
